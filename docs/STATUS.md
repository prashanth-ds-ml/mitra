# Status

**Now:** M0 in progress · **Last updated:** 2026-10-24 · **Repo:** https://github.com/prashanth-ds-ml/mitra
**Plan:** [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) · **Scope:** [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md) · **Decisions:** [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) ·
**Lessons:** [LESSONS.md](LESSONS.md) · **Open errors:** [ERROR_LOG.md](ERROR_LOG.md)

## Next
The next unticked items in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md), M0:
1. CI green on GitHub (Linux + Windows), then GitHub milestones and issues
2. Demo service + fake payments SDK
3. Benchmark v0 (10 tasks), split, preflight, run records
4. Stock-agent overhead + baselines (needs U-002: your logins)

## Machine
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 Laptop, 8 GB (8151 MiB), driver 610.47; `nvidia-smi` power limit N/A (default 80 W)
- RAM: 24 GB · Ollama 0.40.8 · Python 3.12 (shared root `.venv`)

## Notes
- local-codex was imported from its public GitHub version (commit dd93fa6). Its own docs, AGENTS.md, CODEMITRA.md,
  skills.md and codemitra.toml are in `docs/archive/local-codex/` (history, not instructions).
- The package is not installed into the shared venv (a top-level `app` package would clash with other projects); run
  tests from this folder with `../../.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest`.
- `requirements.txt` (old pins) was dropped; a lock file from the tested versions is due before the v0.0 release.
- Shared venv has an unrelated pre-existing conflict (`langgraph-api` vs `opentelemetry-exporter-prometheus`).
